                This is personally my favorite side project. I created a Player Stat Tracker for Leauge of Legends. The
                Tracker
                allows players to search up any player they want, and see their current rank in the game,<br> the amount
                of
                wins
                they have and the amount of losses they have, finally it allows them to see the win loss ratio as a
                percentage along with their scores from the last 5 games.<br> In additon,
                when they search for a player it shows their current profile icon and level. I created this using
                React.js,
                Javascript, and also used axios to pull all the data from the
                Riot games API.

            <div style="display:inline-block;">
                In this group project, my team and I created a resturant application. This application offered three
                types of accounts
                a user account, manager account, and worker account.<br> The user account was used for customers and
                with
                our app they were able to order food, and add/remove items
                from their current cart as they please,<br> in addition it stored the users phone number which they
                could
                update aswell as their credit card information, the user could also view how long their order would take
                and their order number. <br>If the user logged in as a manager they could update the
                current menu aswell as update the picture that was next to the food item, the food item price,
                ingredients, time to make, etc.<br> Finally the worker log in allowed the workers at the resutrant to
                login
                and process a customers order.

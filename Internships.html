    <h2 class="Heading">Software Engineer Intern At OsiSoft/Aveva</h2>
    <div class="Information">
        During this 4 month internship at Aveva, I worked mainly on the users page on the Cloud Platform. The first
        thing I did was refactor the way the users were displayed,
        this is because the Users were being displayed using a very outdated table that was coming for a deprecated
        library. After this I refactored how the users data was being retrived because the way they were currently doing
        it
        was very over engineered and confusing for developers looking at the code for the very first time. Essentially
        what I did was rather than having to use a bunch of different service files created, I made all the data
        retrvial happen within the data service of the users component. In additon, I updated the User's UI to match the
        rest of the pages on the platform, and
        I also created custom filtering with highlighting for the Users across multiple columns of the table, because
        each coulmn stored different information about a user, for example the user first name was in one coulmn and the
        user last name was in another column. Furthmore, I created a reusbale search component that is now being used
        across multiple pages of the platform.

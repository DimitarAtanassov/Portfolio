            <div class="projectDescription">
                This is personally my favorite side project. I created a Player Stat Tracker for League of Legends. The Tracker
                allows players to search up any player they want, and see their current rank in the game,<br> the amount
                of wins they have and the amount of losses they have, finally it allows them to see the win-loss ratio as a
                percentage along with their scores from the last 5 games.<br> In addition,
                when they search for a player it shows their current profile icon and level. I created this using
                React.js,
                Javascript, and also used axios to pull all the data from the
                Riot games API.

            <div class="projectDescription">
                In this group project, my team and I created a restaurant application. This application offered three
                types of accounts
                a user account, manager account, and worker account.<br> The user account was used for customers and
                with
                our app they were able to order food, and add/remove items
                from their current cart as they please,<br> in addition it stored the users phone number which they
                could
                update as well as their credit card information, the user could also view how long their order would take
                and their order number. <br>If the user logged in as a manager they could update the
                current menu as well as update the picture that was next to the food item, the food item price,
                ingredients, time to make, etc.<br> Finally the worker log in allowed the workers at the restaurant to
                login
                and process a customer's order.

            <div class="projectDescription">
                In this group project, my team and I created a Ethereum app for purchasing and trading virtual goods inside of Virtual Reality.<br> 
                Our project aims to provide users with a way to access and
                manage their Ethereum assets and use them in decentralized financial transactions while in
                Augmented Reality,<br>without the need for taking off their VR/AR headset.

            <div class="projectTitle">Discord Name Changer Bot</div>
            <div class="projectDescription">
                I originally created this bot for my World of Warcraft guild members. The goal behind it was to easily link guild members in-game names to discord. <br>
                The reason being that a lot of people had different igns and discord names, and not everyone was following the rules to join the server. <br>
                With my bot, whenever someone joined the discord server they would receive a pm from my bot asking them their in-game name, once the bot got a response <br>
                it would update that person's server nickname to what they had entered, and then gave them permissions to access the rest of the server chat channels.<br>
                And the bot also has a change name command so players could change their server nickname using the bot if they ever changed their in-game name.
